  <p> “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” ¹ </p>
  <p> Truth, it cannot be seen or touched, tasted or smelled, breathed or eaten. Truth, the ultimate form of information when</p>
  <p> the state of affairs between relative (interdependent) concepts seems stable. The illusion of certainty is "truth". </p>
    
    <p> Why can't we know anything for certain? </p>
    <p> Certainty dissolves power of will. Once there potential for events to be determined (certain/True) then beings participating</p>
    <p> in the unraveling nature (experiencing) of such events cannot influence the outcome despite having influence on any multitude</p>
    <p> of factors because albeit all is interdependent, everything holds it's own weight, and thus there is varying impact of influence. </p>
    
    <p>Does power of will mean I have power over my environment?</p>
    <p>No. </p>
    <p>¹ Marcus Aurelius , Meditations</p>
