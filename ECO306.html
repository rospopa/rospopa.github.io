<p>
The purpose of this essay is to articulate the principles and practices of the Federal Reserve Bank in order to identify the factors and policies which determine the future course of the United States economy.<p>
We will begin by taking a look at current macroeconomic trends. We will then determine the relationships between macroeconomic variables and assess how modern monetary policy shapes economic outlooks. Lastly,
we will attempt uncover the future course of the United States economy given current monetary policy.

<h4><b>Principles of Modern Monetarism</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Federal Reserve Bank sells and purchases United States Treasury securities to regulate the money supply. It sells Treasury securities to reduce the money supply, and purchases Treasury securities to increase the money supply. Changes in the money supply cause changes in the interest rates. The money supply and interest rates are inversely related. The more money there is, the less interest lenders will charge borrowers making it easier to borrow, conversely, the less money there is, the more lenders will charge borrowers making it harder to borrow. Financial deregulation and lowering interest rates causes excessive lending and borrowing. So long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable. Over time the debt burdens increases. At some point debt repayments begin growing faster than incomes because too many loans have been made. This forces consumers to cut back on their spending to repay the loans. The fall of consumer spending ripples throughout the economy, causing incomes to fall. As incomes begin to fall, consumer credit begins to fall, and in turn lending and borrowing decreases because there are not as many creditworthy borrowers. Businesses are forced to cut costs and lay off workers, this leads into a full-scale debt deflation. Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay lenders and the economy crumbles, unemployment rises, the economy is in a recession. The Federal Reserve Bank is able to continue printing money because the dollar is the world's reserve currency because most international transactions are made in dollars. Nations that export to the United States use the dollar payments to purchase United States Treasury securities which causes the value of the dollar to increase.A strong dollar causes United States business to become less competitive because it makes United States goods most expensive and businesses exporting into the United States to become more competitive because it makes foreign goods less expensive. On the contrary, when the value of the dollar decreases it causes prices of imports to increase and United States businesses to become more competitive. Although it benefits business to have a strong dollar, consumers are hurt. This is because the prices of exports increase and goods become more expensive as the dollar weakens.
It is a double edged sword, on which one edge is United States business and on the other is the average consumer.

  <h4><b>Macroeconomic Trends</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Federal Reserve Bank is increasing the money supply via Open Market Operations and interest rates are falling. Treasury yields are decreasing. U.S. GDP growth is sluggish. Manufacturing is shrinking. Wages are stagnant while household prices are rising. U.S. debt hit a record high, so did the stock market.

The Federal Reserve Bank is using quantitative easing funds to purchase treasury securities, which causes prices for bonds to rise and yields on those bonds to fall. 
The Federal Reserve Bank is injecting trillion of dollars of liquidity into United States banks. 
Financial institutions need liquidity to keep cash flowing throughout the economy. 
  This liquidity is provided by other financial institutions who are looking to make a return on their investment equal to the repo rate. 
  Recently there was a liquidity shortage during which nobody wanted to lend to the financial institutions, this caused a spike in the repo rate.
  The Federal Reserve Bank interviened to provide billions of dollars in liquidity to the financial institutions in question. 
  In other news, global car market shriking at fastest rate since financial crisis. 
  Delinquencies on auto loans are at an all time high. 
  The Federal Reserve Bank is continuing to inject short-term liquidity and "expects to buy Treausry bills through the middle of next year."

Money is continuing to pour into the high yielding equity market despite poor business sentiment and economic uncertainty. 
The low interest rates are making it easier for corporations to issue debt, some of which is then used to conduct buybacks.
Stock market continues to hit record levels while wage growth has stalled. 
Increased accessibility to equity trading and fallen interest rates enable the populus to invest into stocks on credit. 
Despite technological improvements of the past decade and increased worker productivity, businesses have not translated most of that benefit into worker wages. 
This is a problem because as corporate growth continues to skyrocket, the average consumer is not getting a piece of the pie. 
Without an adequate amount of disposable income, consumers will be forced to sell-back their equity stakes to cover debt repayments.
