The purpose of this essay is to articulate the principles and practices of the Federal Reserve Bank in order to identify the factors and policies which determine the future course of the United States economy. 

We will begin by taking a look at current macroeconomic trends. Then we will determine the relationship between interest rates and macroeconomic variables. Finally, we will assess the future of the United States economy given our current economic data and monetary and fiscal policy decisions.
