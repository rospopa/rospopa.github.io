<H2>United States: Macroeconomic Analysis and Monetarism</h2>

<br>

<p>
The purpose of this essay is to articulate the principles and practices of the Federal Reserve Bank in order to identify the factors and policies which determine the future course of the United States economy. We will begin by taking a look at current economic trends and comparing outlooks from various sources.
  We will then compare outlooks and the variables associated with the differences. Primarily, the focus will be on wage and labor, as a factor of consumption and savings. We will then determine how the Federal Reserve Bank monetary policies impact each variable and apply our knowledge to the current economic state.</b><p>

<li>Open your essay file in Microsoft Word (or WordPerfect if you're using that program).<p>
<li>Also open the <b>template</b> for HTML code that I have provided you. (You should have a copy on your disk.)<p>
<li>At the very top of the <b>template</b>, type in your last name just before the words, "Essay 1."  Make sure you put a comma and a space between your name and "Essay 1."<p>
<li>Now type the title of your essay in between the two tags that look like this: &lt;H2&gt;.  Then immediately below that line type your full name after the word <i>by</i>.<p>
<li>Return to your essay.  Now, using your mouse, <i>highlight your entire essay except for the title and your name</i>.  Then click on the "copy" button at the top of the screen (it looks like two sheets of paper with one lying on top of the other).<p>
<li>Now return to the HTML template and position the cursor at the end of the line that looks like this: &lt;p&gt;
Now click on the "paste" button at the top of the screen (it looks like a sheet of paper on top of a clipboard). Your entire essay should now be in the HTML template<p>
<li>Go back to the beginning of your essay and <b>place a paragraph tag (&lt;p&gt;) at the beginning of each paragraph in your essay</b>.<p>
<li>Once you're finished, go to "File Save As."  A dialogue box will open on your screen.  At the bottom of the box is a small window labeled: "Save File as Type."  Click the little arrow at the end of the window and several options will appear.  Highlight "Text Only."  Then, in the small box at the top left-hand corner of the dialogue box, type in a name for your file as follows: <b>use the first eight letters of your last name followed by a period and the extension <i>htm</i></b>.  Now make sure the "A" drive is selected in the "drive" box and click OK.<p>
</ol>
If you've done everything right, you should now have an HTML file on your disk containing your essay.  When you submit your essays to me, <b>submit both a word processing file and an HTML file</b>.<p>
