<b>What is Digital Forensics?</b>
<p>
The application of computer science and investigative procedures on digital evidence post proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics, use of validated tools that are industry standard, repeatability, reporting, and possible expert presentation.

<h4><b>What is Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<p>
The application of computer science and investigative procedures on digital evidence post proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics, use of validated tools that are industry standard, repeatability, reporting, and possible expert presentation.
</p>
  
<br>
  
  <h4><b>Can private digital data be used in a court of law?</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects everyone’s right to be secure from search and seizure. Since it was written in 1791, before computers and electronic devices, the extent of protections vary state to state. Every U.S. jurisdiction has case law related to the admissibility of evidence recovered from computers and other digital devices. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) were signed into law in 1973, and many states’ rules map to the FRE.
</p>

<br>

    <h4><b>What government agencies handle Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<p>
The FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) formed in 1984, and teamed up with the Department of Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL) by the late 1990s to create a single entity that handles Digital Evidence and Investigations. It is important to note that Digital Forensics is used by the Public-sector for criminal trials, and the Private-sector for policy compliance, and the two may intersect depending on the case.
</p>
  
<br>

    <h4><b>Why do we need Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
                                                            
<p>
Existing laws can’t keep up with the rate of technological change. Digital Forensics expands the scope of evidence in a criminal trial to encompass electronic data. This is the reason that case law in the jurisdiction is important to the viability of the evidence in an investigative trial.
</p>
  
<br>

  <h4><b>What is the process of Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<ol>
<li>Acquire the evidence.</li>
<li>Preserve evidence and transport it to a computer forensics lab.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Evidence bags with seals to secure and catalog the evidence.</li>
    <li>Anti-static bags, and well padded containers.</li>
    <li>Use evidence tape to seal all port openings.</li>
</ul>
<li>Secure evidence in an approved secure container.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevents remote access.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Prepare forensics workstation.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A hardware environment with more port options and accessibility.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Retrieve the evidence from the secure container.</li>
<li>Make a <b>bit-stream</b> image of the evidence.</li>
<li>Return the evidence to the secure container.</li>
<li>Process the copied evidence in the forensics workstation with computer forensics tools.</li>
<li>Write an evidence custody form, <i>chain-of-evidence</i>, to document what has been done with the original evidence and its forensics copies.</li>
</ol>

  <br>
  
<p>As a result, you must produce a final report that is repeatable, with conclusive evidence. Keep a written journal of everything you do that explains computer and network processes and the five Who, What, When, Where, and Why in the digital autopsy report.</p>

<br>

  <h4><b>Getting Started – Investigator’s Office and Laboratory</b></h4>

<br>

  <h4><b>The Forensics Lab</b></h4>
  
<p>
This is where the equipment, hardware, and software that is used to conduct the investigation is stored, along with a secure container section for evidence. This must be a safe and secure environment with floor-to-ceiling walls, door locking mechanism to access level, and a visitors log. There is a ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) that provides accreditation of crime and forensics labs worldwide.
</p>
 
<br>

  <h4><b>Stock Hardware Peripherals</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Digital camera</li>
  <li>Antistatic bags</li>
  <li>External CD/DVD drive</li>
  <li>IDE cables</li>
  <li>Ribbon cables for floppy disks</li>
  <li>Extra USB 3.0 or newer cables and SATA cards</li>
  <li>SCSI cards, preferably ultrawide</li>
  <li>Graphics cards, both PCI and AGP types</li>
  <li>Assorted FireWire and USB adapters</li>
  <li>Hard disk drives and USB drives</li>
  <li>At least two 2.5-inch Notebook IDE hard drives to standard IDE/ATA or SATA adapter</li>
</ul>

<br>

  <h4><b>Stock Software Inventory</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Office</li>
  <li>Hexadecimal editor</li>
  <li>Programming languages (Visual Studio, Perl, or Python)</li>
  <li>Specialized viewers (Quick View)</li>
  <li>Third-party or open-source office suite (Google Docs/OpenOffice)</li>
  <li>Quickbooks accounting application</li>
</ul>

  <br>

  <h4><b>Evidence Container</b></h4>

<p>The container should be a key or combination to access with double redundancy. Place the evidence inside of a locked container, and place the locked container into a locker. The container should have a notepad with a record of access to the container. Change locks and keys if there is a change in staff, or on an annual basis by default. Keep backup access keys and codes, and store all the keys and codes in a secure location that is of equal security to the evidence container.</p>

  <br>

  <h4 style="color:red"><b>For High-Risk Investigations</b></h4>

  <p style="color:red">High-risk investigations demand more security than the minimum lab requirements. TEMPEST facilities are Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) proofed. They are extremely expensive, as the entire space gets coated in cork board which deadens vibrations and lead shielding walls to prevent radio and electrical signals from escaping.</p>
                             
<br>

  <h4><b>The Lab Manager</b></h4>

  <p>The Lab Manager sets up processes for managing cases, promotes group consensus in decision making, maintains fiscal responsibility, enforces ethical standards among lab members, plans updates for the lab, establishes and promotes quality-assurance protocols, seats reasonable schedules, creates and monitors lab policies, and provides a safe and secure workspace.</p>
                                                   
<br>

  <h4><b>Default Lab Procedures</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Escort cleaning crews as they work.</li>
  <li>Maintain two separate trash containers, one for materials unrelated to an investigation and one for sensitive materials.</li>
  <li>Hire specialized companies for disposing of sensitive materials.</li>
  <li>Maintain a sign-in paper log for visitors.</li>
  <li>Use visible or audible indicators that a visitor is inside your premises.</li>
  <li>Install an intrusion alarm system.</li>
  <li>Inspect the facility to ensure that all walls, doors, locks, are secure.</li>
</ul>
  
<br>
