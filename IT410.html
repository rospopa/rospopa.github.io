<b>What is Digital Forensics?</b>
<p>
The application of computer science and investigative procedures on digital evidence post proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics, use of validated tools that are industry standard, repeatability, reporting, and possible expert presentation.

<h4><b>What is Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<p>
The application of computer science and investigative procedures on digital evidence post proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics, use of validated tools that are industry standard, repeatability, reporting, and possible expert presentation.
</p>
  
<br>
  
  <h4><b>Can private digital data be used in a court of law?</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects everyone’s right to be secure from search and seizure. Since it was written in 1791, before computers and electronic devices, the extent of protections vary state to state. Every U.S. jurisdiction has case law related to the admissibility of evidence recovered from computers and other digital devices. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) were signed into law in 1973, and many states’ rules map to the FRE.
</p>

<br>

    <h4><b>What government agencies handle Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<p>
The FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) formed in 1984, and teamed up with the Department of Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL) by the late 1990s to create a single entity that handles Digital Evidence and Investigations. It is important to note that Digital Forensics is used by the Public-sector for criminal trials, and the Private-sector for policy compliance, and the two may intersect depending on the case.
</p>
  
<br>

    <h4><b>Why do we need Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
                                                            
<p>
Existing laws can’t keep up with the rate of technological change. Digital Forensics expands the scope of evidence in a criminal trial to encompass electronic data. This is the reason that case law in the jurisdiction is important to the viability of the evidence in an investigative trial.
</p>
  
<br>

  <h4><b>What is the process of Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<ol>
<li>Acquire the evidence.</li>
<li>Preserve evidence and transport it to a computer forensics lab.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Evidence bags with seals to secure and catalog the evidence.</li>
    <li>Anti-static bags, and well padded containers.</li>
    <li>Use evidence tape to seal all port openings.</li>
</ul>
<li>Secure evidence in an approved secure container.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevents remote access.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Prepare forensics workstation.</li>
  <ul>A hardware environment with more port options and accessibility.</ul>
<li>Retrieve the evidence from the secure container.</li>
<li>Make a <b>bit-stream</b> image of the evidence.</li>
<li>Return the evidence to the secure container.</li>
<li>Process the copied evidence in the forensics workstation with computer forensics tools.</li>
<li>Write an evidence custody form, <i>chain-of-evidence</i>, to document what has been done with the original evidence and its forensics copies.</li>
</ol>

  <p>As a result, you must produce a final report that is repeatable, with conclusive evidence. Keep a written journal of everything you do that explains computer and network processes and the five Who, What, When, Where, and Why in the digital autopsy report.</p>

<br>

  <h4><b>Getting Started – Investigator’s Office and Laboratory</b></h4>

<br>

  <h4><b>The Forensics Lab</b></h4>
  
<p>
This is where the equipment, hardware, and software that is used to conduct the investigation is stored, along with a secure container section for evidence. This must be a safe and secure environment with floor-to-ceiling walls, door locking mechanism to access level, and a visitors log. There is a ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) that provides accreditation of crime and forensics labs worldwide.
