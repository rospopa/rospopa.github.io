<TITLE>Understanding the Home Selling Process</TITLE><BODY>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#6F00B9" vlink="#A88F00">

<p>
The purpose of this post is to educate home owners on the home selling process to give them the confidence and peace of mind to make better decisions.
</p>
  
<br>
  
<h4><b>Evaluation</b></h4>
  
<p>
 When you're about to make a big purchase, you look at similar options and compare the prices. In a similar way, a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) takes into consideration your home and compares it to similar homes that have been sold in the area. This is a tedious process as every home is unique. It often requires the use of tools for data analysis and a keen eye to spot the important variables.
</p>
  
<br>
  
<h4><b>Preperation</b></h4>
  
<p>
Painting the inside, clearing weeds outside, cleaning up is important. Sellers often underestimate the importance of a clean presentation. Remember, it says more about you than about the home itself. Sure, the buyer can clean it up for a few hundred bucks but the first impression makes all the difference. Imagine you're buying a car and it has stickers all over it and a weird smell inside. You know you'll be able to take the stickers off and wind it out, but what kind of feeling does it spark inside? Prepare the property as if the Queen was visiting tomorrow to maximize the sale price.
</p>

<br>

<h4><b>Photos and Listing</b></h4>
  
<p>
Phone photos may seem like a great idea for what does anyone care? 
</p>
  
<br>

    <h4><b>Why do we need Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
                                                            
<p>
Existing laws can’t keep up with the rate of technological change. Digital Forensics expands the scope of evidence in a criminal trial to encompass electronic data. This is the reason that case law in the jurisdiction is important to the viability of the evidence in an investigative trial.
</p>
  
<br>

  <h4><b>What is the process of Digital Forensics?</b></h4>
  
<ol>
<li>Acquire the evidence.</li>
<li>Preserve evidence and transport it to a computer forensics lab.</li>
<ul>
    <li>Evidence bags with seals to secure and catalog the evidence.</li>
    <li>Anti-static bags, and well padded containers.</li>
    <li>Use evidence tape to seal all port openings.</li>
</ul>
<li>Secure evidence in an approved secure container.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevents remote access.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Prepare forensics workstation.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A hardware environment with more port options and accessibility.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Retrieve the evidence from the secure container.</li>
<li>Make a <b>bit-stream</b> image of the evidence.</li>
<li>Return the evidence to the secure container.</li>
<li>Process the copied evidence in the forensics workstation with computer forensics tools.</li>
<li>Write an evidence custody form, <i>chain-of-evidence</i>, to document what has been done with the original evidence and its forensics copies.</li>
</ol>

  <br>
  
<p>As a result, you must produce a final report that is repeatable, with conclusive evidence. Keep a written journal of everything you do that explains computer and network processes and the five Who, What, When, Where, and Why in the digital autopsy report.</p>

<br>

  <h4><b>Getting Started – Investigator’s Office and Laboratory</b></h4>

<br>

  <h4><b>The Forensics Lab</b></h4>
  
<p>
This is where the equipment, hardware, and software that is used to conduct the investigation is stored, along with a secure container section for evidence. This must be a safe and secure environment with floor-to-ceiling walls, door locking mechanism to access level, and a visitors log. There is a ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board (ANAB) that provides accreditation of crime and forensics labs worldwide.
</p>
 
<br>

  <h4><b>Stock Hardware Peripherals</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Digital camera</li>
  <li>Antistatic bags</li>
  <li>External CD/DVD drive</li>
  <li>IDE cables</li>
  <li>Ribbon cables for floppy disks</li>
  <li>Extra USB 3.0 or newer cables and SATA cards</li>
  <li>SCSI cards, preferably ultrawide</li>
  <li>Graphics cards, both PCI and AGP types</li>
  <li>Assorted FireWire and USB adapters</li>
  <li>Hard disk drives and USB drives</li>
  <li>At least two 2.5-inch Notebook IDE hard drives to standard IDE/ATA or SATA adapter</li>
</ul>

<br>

  <h4><b>Stock Software Inventory</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Office</li>
  <li>Hexadecimal editor</li>
  <li>Programming languages (Visual Studio, Perl, or Python)</li>
  <li>Specialized viewers (Quick View)</li>
  <li>Third-party or open-source office suite (Google Docs/OpenOffice)</li>
  <li>Quickbooks accounting application</li>
</ul>

  <br>

  <h4><b>Evidence Container</b></h4>

<p>The container should be a key or combination to access with double redundancy. Place the evidence inside of a locked container, and place the locked container into a locker. The container should have a notepad with a record of access to the container. Change locks and keys if there is a change in staff, or on an annual basis by default. Keep backup access keys and codes, and store all the keys and codes in a secure location that is of equal security to the evidence container.</p>

  <br>

  <h4 style="color:red"><b>For High-Risk Investigations</b></h4>

  <p style="color:red">High-risk investigations demand more security than the minimum lab requirements. TEMPEST facilities are Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) proofed. They are extremely expensive, as the entire space gets coated in cork board which deadens vibrations and lead shielding walls to prevent radio and electrical signals from escaping.</p>
                             
<br>

  <h4><b>The Lab Manager</b></h4>

  <p>The Lab Manager sets up processes for managing cases, promotes group consensus in decision making, maintains fiscal responsibility, enforces ethical standards among lab members, plans updates for the lab, establishes and promotes quality-assurance protocols, seats reasonable schedules, creates and monitors lab policies, and provides a safe and secure workspace.</p>
                                                   
<br>

  <h4><b>Default Lab Procedures</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Escort cleaning crews as they work.</li>
  <li>Maintain two separate trash containers, one for materials unrelated to an investigation and one for sensitive materials.</li>
  <li>Hire specialized companies for disposing of sensitive materials.</li>
  <li>Maintain a sign-in paper log for visitors.</li>
  <li>Use visible or audible indicators that a visitor is inside your premises.</li>
  <li>Install an intrusion alarm system.</li>
  <li>Inspect the facility to ensure that all walls, doors, locks, are secure.</li>
</ul>
  
<br>

  <h4><b>Certification and Training</b></h4>

  <p>Candidates who complete the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS) test are designated as a Certified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE).

ISC2 Certified Cyber Forensics Professional (CCFP) requires knowledge of digital forensics, malware analysis, incident response, e-discovery, and other disciplines related to cyber investigations.</p>
