Find out what stock options are, how they derive their value, and the difference between calls and puts. You'll also discover a variety of different ways you can use stock options to complement your investing portfolio, along with some advantages of trading options over stocks. Options are entirely different investing vehicles than stocks, and you need to learn the rules of the road before you proceed. In this section, we explain the intricacies of option pricing, including the unexpected impact implied volatility can have on your option's value. Brush up on the benefits of leverage, and learn how stock splits and dividends can affect your option trade. There's more than one way to enter an options trade -- and there are a few different ways to exit the position, as well. Before you start trading, you need to learn the finer points of buying to open, selling to close, exercise, and assignment ... and that's just for starters. In addition, you'll learn how to adjust an open position to account for changes in your forecast, and we'll also review some important principles of money management to keep you trading options profitably. Options trading comes with its own unique set of lingo, and the flurry of unfamiliar buzzwords and phrases can be daunting for newcomers. When it all starts sounding like Greek -- even when you're not researching delta, gamma, and rho -- consult our handy glossary to decode the jargon.

<h4><b>Principles of Modern Monetarism</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Federal Reserve Bank sells and purchases United States Treasury securities to regulate the money supply. It sells Treasury securities to reduce the money supply, and purchases Treasury securities to increase the money supply. Changes in the money supply cause changes in the interest rates. The money supply and interest rates are inversely related. The more money there is, the less interest lenders will charge borrowers making it easier to borrow, conversely, the less money there is, the more lenders will charge borrowers making it harder to borrow. Financial deregulation and lowering interest rates causes excessive lending and borrowing. So long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable. Over time the debt burdens increases. At some point debt repayments begin growing faster than incomes because too many loans have been made. This forces consumers to cut back on their spending to repay the loans. The fall of consumer spending ripples throughout the economy, causing incomes to fall. As incomes begin to fall, consumer credit begins to fall, and in turn lending and borrowing decreases because there are not as many creditworthy borrowers. Businesses are forced to cut costs and lay off workers, this leads into a full-scale debt deflation. Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay lenders and the economy crumbles, unemployment rises, the economy is in a recession. The Federal Reserve Bank is able to continue printing money because the dollar is the world's reserve currency because most international transactions are made in dollars. Nations that export to the United States use the dollar payments to purchase United States Treasury securities which causes the value of the dollar to increase.A strong dollar causes United States business to become less competitive because it makes United States goods most expensive and businesses exporting into the United States to become more competitive because it makes foreign goods less expensive. On the contrary, when the value of the dollar decreases it causes prices of imports to increase and United States businesses to become more competitive. Although it benefits business to have a strong dollar, consumers are hurt. This is because the prices of exports increase and goods become more expensive as the dollar weakens.
It is a double edged sword, on which one edge is United States business and on the other is the average consumer.

  <h4><b>Macroeconomic Trends</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Federal Reserve Bank is increasing the money supply via Open Market Operations and interest rates are falling. Treasury yields are decreasing. U.S. GDP growth is sluggish. Manufacturing is shrinking. Wages are stagnant while household prices are rising. U.S. debt hit a record high, so did the stock market.
