Find out what stock options are, how they derive their value, and the difference beten calls and puts. You'll also discover a variety of different ways you can use stock options to complement your investing portfolio, along with some advantages of trading options over stocks. Options are entirely different investing vehicles than stocks, and you need to learn the rules of the road before you proceed. In this section, we'll explain the intricacies of option pricing, including the unexpected impact implied volatility can have on your option's value. Brush up on the benefits of leverage, and learn how stock splits and dividends can affect your option trade. There's more than one way to enter an options trade -- and there are a few different ways to exit the position, as well. Before you start trading, you need to learn the finer points of buying to open, selling to close, exercise, and assignment ... and that's just for starters. In addition, you'll learn how to adjust an open position to account for changes in your forecast, and we'll also review some important principles of money management to keep you trading options profitably. Options trading comes with its own unique set of lingo, and the flurry of unfamiliar buzzwords and phrases can be daunting for newcomers. When it all starts sounding like Greek -- even when you're not researching delta, gamma, and rho -- consult our handy glossary to decode the jargon.

<h4><b>What Are Stock Options?</b></h4>
  
<p>
Stock options are contracts that represent the right to buy (or sell) shares of the underlying equity at a predetermined price, and by a predetermined date.  Stock options are traded in units called "contracts," which are typically based on 100 shares of the underlying equity. For this reason, options are classified as "derivatives," since they derive their value from an underlying asset.
<br><br>
Call options gain value from a move higher in the underlying stock, while put options increase in value when the underlying stock moves lower. However, stock options can be bought and sold in a variety of different combinations, allowing traders to fine-tune strategies to match with their market outlook -- whether it's bullish, bearish, neutral, or somewhere in between.
<br><br>
It's important to note that buying a stock option contract does not obligate you to buy or sell the actual shares of the underlying stock. It only signifies that you have the right (or "option") to buy or sell those shares.
<br><br>
Furthermore, in certain applications, stock options can even be used to hedge other investments -- which means these contracts are useful not only as purely speculative tools, but also as portfolio "insurance" during times of market turmoil.
<br><br>
The expiration date on your option contract might be days, weeks, or months in the future, but this date determines how much time the underlying equity has to move as you expected. Similarly, the price at which you agree to buy or sell the shares -- known as the "strike price" or "exercise price" -- is fixed.
<br><br>
For investors who are more accustomed to trading shares of stocks directly, education is an absolute requirement before transitioning to calls and puts. Even though the value of stock options is based upon the price of the underlying equity, there are several other factors in play that can influence the premium of your contracts.

  <h4><b>Macroeconomic Trends</b></h4>
  
<p>
The Federal Reserve Bank is increasing the money supply via Open Market Operations and interest rates are falling. Treasury yields are decreasing. U.S. GDP growth is sluggish. Manufacturing is shrinking. Wages are stagnant while household prices are rising. U.S. debt hit a record high, so did the stock market.
