Find out what stock options are, how they derive their value, and the difference beten calls and puts. You'll also discover a variety of different ways you can use stock options to complement your investing portfolio, along with some advantages of trading options over stocks. Options are entirely different investing vehicles than stocks, and you need to learn the rules of the road before you proceed. In this section, we'll explain the intricacies of option pricing, including the unexpected impact implied volatility can have on your option's value. Brush up on the benefits of leverage, and learn how stock splits and dividends can affect your option trade. There's more than one way to enter an options trade -- and there are a few different ways to exit the position, as well. Before you start trading, you need to learn the finer points of buying to open, selling to close, exercise, and assignment ... and that's just for starters. In addition, you'll learn how to adjust an open position to account for changes in your forecast, and we'll also review some important principles of money management to keep you trading options profitably. Options trading comes with its own unique set of lingo, and the flurry of unfamiliar buzzwords and phrases can be daunting for newcomers. When it all starts sounding like Greek -- even when you're not researching delta, gamma, and rho -- consult our handy glossary to decode the jargon.

<h4><b>What Are Stock Options?</b></h4>
  
<p>
Stock options are contracts that represent the right to buy (or sell) shares of the underlying equity at a predetermined price, and by a predetermined date.  Stock options are traded in units called "contracts," which are typically based on 100 shares of the underlying equity. For this reason, options are classified as "derivatives," since they derive their value from an underlying asset.
<br><br>
Call options gain value from a move higher in the underlying stock, while put options increase in value when the underlying stock moves lower. However, stock options can be bought and sold in a variety of different combinations, allowing traders to fine-tune strategies to match with their market outlook -- whether it's bullish, bearish, neutral, or somewhere in between.
<br><br>
It's important to note that buying a stock option contract does not obligate you to buy or sell the actual shares of the underlying stock. It only signifies that you have the right (or "option") to buy or sell those shares.
<br><br>
Furthermore, in certain applications, stock options can even be used to hedge other investments -- which means these contracts are useful not only as purely speculative tools, but also as portfolio "insurance" during times of market turmoil.
<br><br>
The expiration date on your option contract might be days, weeks, or months in the future, but this date determines how much time the underlying equity has to move as you expected. Similarly, the price at which you agree to buy or sell the shares -- known as the "strike price" or "exercise price" -- is fixed.
<br><br>
For investors who are more accustomed to trading shares of stocks directly, education is an absolute requirement before transitioning to calls and puts. Even though the value of stock options is based upon the price of the underlying equity, there are several other factors in play that can influence the premium of your contracts.
</p>
  
<br>
  
  <h4><b>What Is a Call Option? How Do I Trade Calls?</b></h4>
  
<p>
A call option is a contract that gains value when the underlying stock rises.  In the most basic sense, then, a call option is a bet that the underlying security will rise in price, enabling you to profit from your investment. However, call options can also be combined with other types of option contracts to construct a number of different bullish, bearish, and directionally neutral trading strategies.
<br><br>
Sticking to the basics for now, a call option that's being used to speculate on higher prices for the underlying stock will be bought to open by a bullish trader. The purchase of this option gives the holder the right -- but not the obligation -- to buy 100 shares of that stock at the strike price, in the event the stock should rise above that strike prior to expiration.
<br><br>
The contract(s) are purchased for an initial upfront cost, known as the "premium." In a straightforward call-buying strategy, the premium paid to acquire a call option is also the maximum potential loss on the trade, should the stock fail to live up to bullish expectations.
<br><br>
A call option is "in the money" when the price of the underlying stock exceeds the strike price of the option. An in-the-money call can be exercised by the holder in order to acquire the shares at a discount to the current market price. Alternately, the contract can be sold to close before it expires, in which case the trader's profit would stem from the gain in the option's premium over the lifetime of the trade.
<br><br>
If an in-the-money call expires without being proactively exercised or sold to close, it may be exercised by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). This process is automatic for any options that are in the money by $0.01 or more, unless alternate instructions are provided by the option holder. Traders who do not want their in-the-money calls to be exercised upon expiration should discuss the available choices with their brokers.
